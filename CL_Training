PRODUCT DEFINITION: i) prod code: unique identifier, 
		    ii)prod type: loan,commitment

Product preferences:
1)rollover allowed for product or not
2)liquidation is auto or manual
3)holiday preferences for the schedules
4)As part of prod setup we define different types of component to be linked to the product:
i)prinicipal
ii)int:
iii)penalty:
For interest & penalty component we need to define 
	a) the basis element:basis of computation,
	b)accrual preferences:whether to accrue or not,accrual freq
iv)charge or fees to be charged for any particular CL event
v)verify funds as part of auto liq
vi)schedule structure: define freq of schedule:M,Q

-for amort loans define payment schedule only for main-int component,no payment schedule to be defined for principal 
component as the schedule structure is same for AMORT loans.
-for simple we need to define the schedule for both principal & maint_int component.
-for main-int & penalty components we need to additionally define formula depending whether loan is simple or amort

formulate setup
---------------
SDE:system data element whose value derived internally by system.For example: i) principal_expected which is what is used in interest calculation.
It is defined internally based on the schedule structure.
,ii)principal_schodue, iii)maint_int_schodue

UDE:user data element.For ex: rate for int & penalty components.

As part of your component definition. For example MAINT_INT: you need define whether it amortized or simple formula.
There are factoryship formula available for simple & amortized loan.You will use the SDE & UDE as part of formula definition.
As part of formula definition First you need to give the formula name.For maint interest it is possible u may require multiple formula.
For instance u may had dual formula kit where you may define the simple formula for initial part of the loan followed by amortized formula.
you will define 2 separate formula & in your schedule structure you will define not just the component name but also the formula and duration of the
schedule. 
Likewise you also need define formula for the penalty component. In this case SDE you will be using may be PRINCIPAL_SCHODUE OR MAIN_INT_SCHODUE
depending on what basis you want to compute the penalty.

As part of schedule definition you may also choose to capitalize your interest(check flag for capiltalization).
For main interest you can also define a moratorium formula.During this duration customer does not have to pay any interest.
So, this int accrued during moratorium  is collected later either as part of future non-moratorium interest schedule or it may be capitalized to principal.
There is a separate button for desigining moratorium schedule & you can define both the default moratorium formula as well as moratorium liquidation formula.
And, once this formula are in place, you may add this particular moratorium formula as part of schedule structure when you define the maint interest component.

5) As part of product definition, you need to define the events for CL loan product.
common events:book, init,mliq,aliq,status_change,rollover.you need define the necessary accounting entries for these events & role to head mapping(underline GL head)
-also need to define status change in case prod requires status change setup. you have to define different statuses required for the product along with the adversity 
leveland also the condition/rules under which the account will change the status.you will define accrual preferences for the status(where you may wish to stop accrual
 or accrue in suspended state).For each status u also need to define the liq order.Also, you need to define the accounting entris for status change as well incase
status change requires balance movement is required(balance movement from 1 GL to another).

After product is saved & authorized it creates C3PK# dynamic package.
********************************************************************************************************************************************************************

FOR AMORT:
FOR SIMPLE:
--------------------------------------------
LOAN BOOKING:
prod,amt,value dt,maturity dt :attributes of loan
int & penalty rates cud be either fixed(specify the rate value) or floating(link the rate_code to ude[usage can be periodic.in this case u need to define the 
revision schedule][automatic:cftm_rate_maint])
most preferences are defaulted from product.some preferences can be changed at account level.
amort:payment schd structure only for main_int
simple:payment schd structure for both maint_int & principal.

for any loan bullet schedule is mandatory
bullet schedule:01-jan-15 to 01-jan-16. (here 01-jan-15 to 01-dec-15:monthly schedule of account 11) (01-dec-15 to 01-jan-16 as bullet).
if you hv chosen the rate_code as periodic then u need to also define the revision schedule.
if the disbursement is auto then u need to define disbursement schedule ,structure is similiar to payment & disb will be done as part of batch.

auto liq: check availibilty of funds
manual liq: not done in batch


PAYMENT: normal/advanced/pre
i)normal : pay is made on or after the schedule due date.
ii)pre: pay is made before sch is due.only principal can be pre paid. int can only be paid until accrued.this will internally trigger sch re-structure.
pre payment threshold amount can be defined. it will not allow payments below this threshold & also not during moratorium period.
iii)advanced:future schedules can be paid for both int & principal(installment flag is checked here).this will not trigger sch re-structure.
partial advance pay cannot be made.

CLDPMNT
----------
account_no,brn,value_dt,limit_date(is the date upto which u want to do the payment),settlement_account,
capitalization can be done irrespective of the preference at the prod/contract level.

reversal of payment to be done in reverse order(order of latest payment)
RACR:reversal of accrual.mandatory maint at prod level needs to be done. For instance: incase of back dated payment or back dated prepayment.
system internally re-computes accrual for main_int & penalty & need to trigger reversals of accrual already done.accounting entry setup mandatory to be done in this 
case.

VAMI:value dated amendment can be both financial or non-financial amendment.
-----
financial:principal increase,maturity dt change,rate code or rate change.when vami is booked it triggers a vami event on initiation date.
vami can be booked back dated,current dated or future dated vami. in case future dated vami, eod batch will initiate the vami event on application.
vami creates a version additionally along with the event. to undo the effect of vami, u need to trigger version reversal.u need to go to account screen
& choose the verion to be reversed.to reverse the contract, select version 1 to reverse the loan contract.

STATUS CHANGE:auto during eod. manually can be done from CLDSTCHG

CL BATCH OPERATION(EOD/BOD): 
----------------------------
aliq(accounts configured for auto liq based on preference selected for verification of funds),penal function(to compute 
penalty for over-due schedules),sub function for status change(trigger status chg based on rules defined at prod level),other processes(accrual for main int & penalty,
revision -ARVN(auto revision),REVN(periodic revision),auto rollover,future dated vami processing.

COMMON TABLES:
--------------
cltb_account_apps_master:master table for loan account
acc_no,brn(pk key),value_dt,amt_dt,mat dt,amt financed,amt disbursed,account status(L,A,V,Y),latest esn,version no

acc no,brn,eff dt,ude id,ude value,resolved value,Code usage(A/P),maint resolve(M/R)

cltb_account_comp_sch:created as per schedule structure
acc,brn,comp name,formula name,sch type(P/R/D),sch flag(N/M),start dt,end dt,no of schedules,freq,unit,first_due_dt(imp as it links with cltb_account_schedules tables),
capitalized flag,emi amount,waiver flag

non-mora main int schedules)

cltb_account_comp_balances:principal expected(this column is only used,used for int computation),system derives it value internally based on the sch structure defined.
On prepayment it is restructured.

cltb_account_events_diary:event log table,both processed & unprocessed.

cltb_event_entries:cl equivalent of accounting entries

cltb_event_entries_pending:entries yet to be posted to accounting

cltb_account_vamd:where data is populated when vami operation is done

cltb_liq: liq master table(auto,manual,reversal of payment details)
cltb_liq_comp_settled
cltb_liq_settlement
cltb_liq_comp_summary:breakup of paid,due,over dues amount for a particular CL loan.
cltb_amount_paid:details of the payment(N/P/A pay status)

cltb_account_comp_bal_breakup:component-wise status & GL wise outstanding balances for all the components.typically used for liq & status change.
update on this table depends on the prod event accounting entry definition,accrual,status change event which needs to paas accounting entries.
when doing liq during EOD this table is checked for which GL the entry is supposed to be passed.

cltp/_history tables:snap of the table before payment/vami event.
